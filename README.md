# Udacitask, Part 1

## Project Overview

For this project, you're going to create a command line to-do list using object oriented principles. The to-do list will be able to perform basic tasks such as adding to and deleting from the list, and marking items as complete. It will also have three new features (that you will get to choose) that improve its functionality.
