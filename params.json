{"name":"Udacitask","tagline":"Task manager built in Ruby to run on the command line","body":"Udacitask, Part 1-2\r\n\r\nBuilt a commandline application using Object Oriented Ruby that keeps track of your tasks and helps you to stay organized.  The app parses and reads JSON data and converts it into native Ruby Data structures.  It uses classic Object Oriented Programming in order to intelligently manipulate the data.\r\n\r\nThe app utilizes modules and both existing and custom Ruby Gems in order to extend the capabilities.\r\n\r\nIf you’re familiar with microblogging sites, you’ll know that they usually allow you to define different types of posts like “text”, “quote”, “image”, or  “link”. All of the posts are then listed in one big stream, with different formatting depending on the type of post.\r\n\r\n[Specifications for Project 2](https://github.com/ryan-collins-forks/Project-Descriptions-for-Review/blob/master/Ruby/Udacitask%202.md)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
