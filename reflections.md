# What you added to Udacitask 2.0
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. What is the gem of your choice and how did you use it?
I used Sinatra as the gem of my choice.  I used it to create a very basic web application that interfaces with the data stored through the comandline application.  At this point, I am getting a bit antsy to build web applications and I saw this as an opportunity to begin doing so. 

In order to get setup with Sinatra, I read the documentation.  I copied a bit of boilerplate CSS from the HTML5 Boilerplate and I created a layout.erb and an index.erb file that contains partials that make up the web app.  The app loads all of the TodoList type entries and it allows the user to add to the list through the form.

2. Describe the 2 features you added to the project.
  a) I created a web application that shows the todo list.  I utilized Sinatra to do so.
  b) I also made the list editable from the web interface.  You can edit, delete and update items from the web interface!  Sweet!

# REFLECTIONS
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. How long did you spend working on this project?
I spent about 8 hours working on this project.  It was a lot of run to get my hands dirty with Sinatra and was worth the time.

2. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
The most rewarding challenge was building a Sinatra web app!  I mean, if I was able to build this app in about 8 hours, I will be amazed at what I can build once I take the Rails Nanodegree.  I can't wait to start building web apps with Sinatra and Rails.

3. What two additional features did you build? Why?
I built a Sinatra web interface and also set it up to edit the todo list items through the web interface.  I think it's probably obvious why!  I want to build web apps :)!

4. Where do you still have room to grow?
I have to learn a bit more about Ruby app architecture and I have to study the best practices.  To be honest, I wasn't sure exactly what the best way to go about setting this app up was.  I knew that I should build partials and have Sinatra render them using erb, but I would like to understand more than that.
