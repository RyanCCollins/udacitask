# What you added to Udacitask 2.0
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. What is the gem of your choice and how did you use it?
I used Sinatra as the gem of my choice.  I used it to create a very basic web application that interfaces with the data stored through the comandline application.  At this point, I am getting a bit antsy to build web applications and I saw this as an opportunity to begin doing so. 

In order to get setup with Sinatra, I read the documentation.  I copied a bit of boilerplate CSS from the HTML5 Boilerplate and I created a layout.erb and an index.erb file that contains partials that make up the web app.  The app loads all of the TodoList type entries and it allows the user to add to the list through the form.

2. Describe the 2 features you added to the project.
  a) Aside from creating a web facing todo list, I also added the ability to edit the todo list from the web application.
  b)
